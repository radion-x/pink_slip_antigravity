# Blue Slips in NSW Australia: Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

A Blue Slip, officially known as an Authorised Unregistered Vehicle Inspection Scheme (AUVIS) report, is a critical safety inspection document required for unregistered vehicles in New South Wales. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of Blue Slips, including their purpose, requirements, procedures, costs, and how they differ from other NSW vehicle inspection types.

## What is a Blue Slip?

A Blue Slip is an authorised safety inspection report that verifies an unregistered vehicle meets NSW requirements for roadworthiness, design standards, and vehicle identity standards. The inspection is mandatory for all unregistered light vehicles before they can be registered with Transport for NSW. The report provides official documentation that a vehicle is safe to drive and eligible for registration in the state.

### Official Definition

According to Transport for NSW and the NSW Government, a Blue Slip serves to:

- Verify that an unregistered vehicle is mechanically safe
- Confirm the vehicle meets design and identity standards
- Ensure the vehicle complies with NSW regulatory requirements
- Provide documentation necessary for vehicle registration[1]

### How Blue Slips Differ from Other NSW Inspection Types

NSW has three distinct vehicle inspection/insurance types that are often confused:

#### Blue Slip vs Pink Slip

**Blue Slip (AUVIS)**
- For unregistered vehicles or those being registered for the first time
- More comprehensive and thorough inspection
- Required for vehicles of any age (if unregistered)
- Includes identity verification and design compliance checks
- Must be passed before initial registration

**Pink Slip (eSafety Check)**
- For vehicles already registered in NSW
- Required only for vehicles over five years old
- Required annually as part of registration renewal
- Checks roadworthiness only
- Less comprehensive than a Blue Slip inspection

#### Blue Slip vs Green Slip

**Blue Slip (AUVIS)**
- Safety and design inspection report
- Required before vehicle registration
- Verifies mechanical and structural standards
- Not insurance

**Green Slip (Compulsory Third Party Insurance/CTP)**
- Mandatory insurance policy
- Covers medical expenses and injury costs from motor vehicle accidents
- Protects third parties injured by your vehicle
- Must be obtained before registration[2]

**Important Note:** You need BOTH a Blue Slip and a Green Slip to complete vehicle registration in NSW. The Blue Slip proves the vehicle is safe; the Green Slip provides the required insurance coverage.

## When Do You Need a Blue Slip?

A Blue Slip inspection is required in the following specific circumstances:

### Registration Expired More Than 3 Months

If your vehicle's registration has lapsed for more than three months, you must obtain a Blue Slip before you can re-register the vehicle in NSW. This ensures that vehicles that have been off the road for an extended period still meet current safety standards.

### Vehicle Transferred from Another State or Territory

When transferring a vehicle from interstate or bringing a vehicle that was previously registered in another Australian state or territory into NSW, a Blue Slip inspection is mandatory. The inspection must be completed within two weeks of the vehicle arriving in NSW.

### Vehicle Imported from Overseas

Imported vehicles require a Blue Slip inspection before NSW registration. In addition to the Blue Slip, you must provide the authorised examiner with a vehicle import approval issued by the Australian Government's Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications.

### Vehicle Has No Number Plates

If your vehicle has no number plates or the plates have been removed, a Blue Slip inspection is required before registration can be processed.

### Vehicle Was Written-Off but Approved for Re-registration

Vehicles that have been declared write-offs by insurance companies can be re-registered in NSW, but only after passing a Blue Slip inspection to confirm they are safe and meet all design standards.

### Significant Modifications or Changes to Vehicle Records

A Blue Slip inspection may be required if significant changes have been made to the vehicle, including:

- Engine replacement or major engine modifications
- Colour change
- Seating configuration changes
- Gross vehicle mass changes
- Other major structural or mechanical modifications

### Defect Notices Requiring Clearance

If your vehicle has been issued defect notices by Police or Transport for NSW, you must have the vehicle inspected and pass a Blue Slip inspection to clear these defects before the vehicle can legally be driven on NSW roads.

**How to Find an AIS Station:**
- Search online for "AUVIS accredited inspection stations NSW"
- Check the Transport for NSW website for a list of accredited providers
- Ask at local automotive repair shops for referrals
- AIS stations typically display an "AIS" sign at their premises listing the types of inspections they're authorised to perform

### Step 2: Preparing Your Vehicle

Before taking your vehicle for inspection, ensure it is in the best possible condition:

**Vehicle Maintenance Checklist:**
- Check all light bulbs and ensure they function correctly
- Check tyre tread depth and pressure (critical failure point)
- Top up all fluids (oil, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid)
- Ensure no obvious leaks are present
- Check all seatbelts function correctly
- Clean the vehicle interior and remove loose items
- Give the vehicle exterior a thorough wash
- Ensure sufficient fuel for the inspection (typically need 10km of driving capability for test drive)

### Step 3: Preparing Required Documentation

Before attending your Blue Slip inspection, gather all required documentation:

**Essential Documents:**
- Government-issued photo identification (driver's license preferred)
- Proof of vehicle purchase such as:
  - Certificate of Registration signed by previous owner

- Perform an identity check to verify VIN and engine number
- Verify design compliance
- Take your vehicle on a test drive (typically up to 10km) to assess road performance
- Record all findings in the inspection report

### Step 5: Inspection Results

**If Your Vehicle Passes:**
- You will receive a Blue Slip inspection report
- The report is valid for 42 days from the date of inspection
- The report is typically sent electronically to Transport for NSW
- You must retain the original hard copy of the report to present when registering your vehicle at Service NSW
- You can then proceed to register the vehicle with the Green Slip (CTP insurance) and registration at a Service NSW Centre

**If Your Vehicle Fails:**
- You will be informed of all defects identified
- You have 14 days to repair the defects identified
- You must return to the same AIS station for reassessment
- If repairs are completed within 14 days at the same station, no additional inspection fee applies
